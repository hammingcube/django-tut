Remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

(The reason there’s separate commands to make and apply migrations is because you’ll commit migrations to your version control system and ship them with your app; they not only make your development easier, they’re also useable by other developers and in production.)
